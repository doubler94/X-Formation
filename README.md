# X-Formation
To open this application, you have to download project and open file "index.html". Then you can go to contributors (list or table) oraz Repositories (list or table). You can also check 2 unit tests.

This application is compatible with browsers: Mozilla Firefox and Safari. If you want see application on browsers Opera, Vivaldi, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer, you have to run this application from the program (I used WebStorm), because this browsers don't support application from folder path (they need localhost).
